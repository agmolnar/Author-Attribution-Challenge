# Author-Attribution-Challenge

This repository contains the code for my team's solution to the Author Attribution Task as part of an assessment for a Machine Learning course.
Our solution makes use of the TFIDF Vectorizer and the LinearSVC algorithm to predict author names from article metadata (which includes Abstract, Year of Publication and Title).
After extensive hyperparameter tuning, we obtain 25.28% test accuracy and secure 2nd place out of 52 groups.

Unfortunately the dataset used cannot be shared here, but I believe our approach could be applied to another similar dataset without many changes needed.
